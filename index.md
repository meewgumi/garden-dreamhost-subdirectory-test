## Jekyll on Apache servers
This digital garden template runs on Apache servers with the LAMP stack. Jekyll build commands are run on [DeployHQ](https://www.deployhq.com/), then deployed to Dreamhost via SSH. Notes are maintained in Markdown format with Obsidian. This version of the template was modified by [Megumi Tanaka](https://megumi.co) in 2021. [Github code is available here](https://github.com/meewgumi/apache-digital-garden).

Based on this [digital garden template](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template) created by [Maxime Vaillancourt](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt).  [Buy the original creator a coffee](https://ko-fi.com/maximevaillancourt)! ‚òïÔ∏è
